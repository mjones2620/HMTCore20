                            Welcome! It takes a great amount of courage to make the first step to living your best life.
                            Positive healthy mind, positive healthy body. What’s your mantra? I know how it feels to be
                            so anxious and unmotivated you feel life will never improve. I am not only a Licensed Professional
                            Counselor with over seven years experience providing direct patient care to adults, adolescents,
                            children, and families, but I am your average every day girl who has dealt with her own array of challenges.
                            By changing my thoughts and developing positive, healthy coping skills, I created a positive healthy
                            mind, body and soul. I provide a safe, supportive, encouraging environment by creating a solid foundation
                            for personal healing and development. I work to create a relationship with you to promote success and empowerment.
                            I recognize you are the expert on your life and take a collaborative approach to achieve identified goals.
                            I use a strength-based approach, building on your positive qualities. I recognize everyone measures success
                            differently and tailor treatment to best meet your needs. Are you struggling with every day anxieties that
                            are starting to impact your relationships, job, or home life? Do you feel so depressed you have lost motivation
                            to do things you used to enjoy? Do you have a teenager who seems distant but has hinted they would like someone to talk to?
                            If you can relate to any of this, then you’ve come to the right place. Healthy Minds
                            Therapy will help you become the person you want to be!

                            During my journey as a therapist thus far, I have had the pleasure of working with clients in a variety
